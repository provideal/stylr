Kicker
======

Kicker provides a collection of reusable CSS stuff based on [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) and 
[Compass](http://compass-style.org) packaged as Rails 3.1 engine.

This project is Heavily inspired by [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) 
and uses some of it's css code.

WARNING: Under heavy development: I think I should write that this gem is not yet production ready. 
So you should probably wait a bit if you want to use that.

Usage

TBD.
